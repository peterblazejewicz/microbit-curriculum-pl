In this project, children will learn how to use input events to execute sequences of instructions, by making an interactive badge. Pressing the buttons on the micro:bit will change the image that's displayed.

#Resources
For this project, the [PXT](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.
