title: Frustration â€” Notes for Club Leaders
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use variables in making a wire-following game. The aim of the game is to guide a wand along a course without making contact. Making contact will add one to the player's score - the player with the lowest score wins.

#Resources

To complete this project, children will need:

+ Metal wire (approx. 50cm);
+ Putty;
+ Electrical tape (optional);
+ Crocodile leads (optional).

Steps 1 and 2 of this project can be completed without this equipment.

For this project, the [Code Kingdoms](http://jumpto.cc/mb-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [microbit.co.uk/jrvivm](https://www.microbit.co.uk/jrvivm), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

#Learning Objectives
+ Variables;
+ Input/output (I/O) pins.

#Challenges
+ "Display an image" - Display an image on the micro:bit before the number of `fails` is displayed.
+ "Cheat mode!" - Subtract 1 from the `fails` variable when button B is pressed.
+ "Personalise your game" - Make changes to the wand and course in order to make the game more difficult.
