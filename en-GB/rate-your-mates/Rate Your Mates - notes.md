#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make use of variables and random numbers by making a compatibility program. Two users will each press a button on the micro:bit, which will then tell them their compatibility percentage.

#Resources
For this project, the [Code Kingdoms](http://jumpto.cc/mb-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [microbit.co.uk/tewqjx](https://www.microbit.co.uk/tewqjx), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:
